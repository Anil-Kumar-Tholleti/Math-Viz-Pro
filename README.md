# Math Problem Solution Templates 📝

This repository contains a front-end project designed to display step-by-step solutions to mathematical problems using predefined HTML and CSS templates. The goal is to populate these templates with the correct calculations without altering their core structure or styling.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main objective is to solve two distinct types of math problems by selecting the appropriate template and dynamically inserting the solution steps. This project emphasizes the separation of data (the math solution) from presentation (the HTML/CSS template).

* **Template 1:** Solves linear, arithmetic-based problems.
* **Template 2:** Solves problems involving powers or compound interest.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Modular Templates:** Two distinct, reusable HTML templates for different problem types.
* **Visual Logic Flow:** Uses custom arrow icons (`arrow.png`) to guide the user through each step of the calculation.
* **Thematic Icons:** Includes specific icons (`interesticon.png`) to visually represent the problem's theme.
* **Strict Structural Integrity:** The primary challenge is to work within the rigid constraints of the provided HTML structure and CSS.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Choose a Problem:** Identify a math problem you want to solve.
3.  **Select the Right Template:**
    * For a linear problem, open `template1_solution.html`.
    * For an interest/power problem, open `template2_solution.html`.
4.  **Populate the Solution:** Edit the HTML file. Change only the text, numbers, and variables inside the existing `divs` to reflect your step-by-step solution.
5.  **View the Result:** Open the modified HTML file in your web browser to see the fully rendered solution.

## 📜 Rules and Constraints

This project follows a strict set of rules for modifying the templates.

#### ✔️ **You Are Allowed To:**
* Adjust the content (numbers, variables, descriptive text) inside existing HTML elements.
* Change images and icons, as long as their size and style remain consistent with the overall layout.

#### ❌ **You Are NOT Allowed To:**
* Modify the external `style.css` file.
* Change the HTML structure (do not add, remove, or reorder `divs` or other elements).
* Alter the layout or positioning of any components.
